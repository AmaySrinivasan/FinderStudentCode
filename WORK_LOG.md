| Nov 2 |  9-10pm  | Started working throuhg the problemset. At first, I wasthinking of just trying to figure out a way to get through the problemset, and thenw ork on efficiency from there. I realized that this would be straightforward, but nearly impossible to optimize to the oint where it works. So I decided to try and use what we used earlier with a hash function to do the looping through. I was able to make the hash function pretty easily because it was really similar to what we had done previously. Also, at first, I was thinking of using two parallel arrays for keys and values, but the problem with this would have been collisions, so I decided to use an array of lists where each lists wholds keys and values that hash to the same thing. I was also able to build the buildtable function in this time because I thought that it was pretty straightforward in my head. The confusing part was with query because I didn't really understand what was going on with it. To me, the other parts were pretty intuitive inmy approach, so I was able to just code throuhg it. I wasn't able to really test my code because I hadn't done query quite yet, so I didn't really have something to test, but I thought that it went pretty well. |

I decided to use lists because I thought that it fit my intentions a lot better with the problem set, despite having a cost witht he amount of data it holds. This was interesting to figure out, so I had to slightly alter my implementation of the buildtable and hash functions. i also found a couple of errors with making sure that the invalid lines were skipped, so I had to fix that. Other than that, I was vry sure that my buildtable was working at this point in time. |
| Nov 3 |  8-9pm   |                                                                                                                                Went through and implemented query. This was confusing at first because I initially forgot to add a .size(), but I didn't realize it, so it kept showing this weird error because I was literally comparing a number with an array, which makes no sense. I was able to read carefully through it and realized I made that error, so I was able to fix it. I solved this because having given a key, I could hash it to et the index, then loops through the list and if I find the same key, return teh matching value, otehrwise return an invalid key. This was actually pretty straightforward and I realized that it made sense when taking into consideration the other parts of my code. I also realized I had made an error earlier with my constructor, so I had to fix that, but that was also decently straightforward. My code complied, and it actually worked, but it was too slow, so I tried to add improvements with my hash function iand its use in build TAble, but it still was pretty inefficient when I finished my time (although it did pass the test when I ran it, which was pretty ncie to see). |
