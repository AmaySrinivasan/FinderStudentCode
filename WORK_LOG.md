At first, I wasthinking of just trying to figure out a way to get through the problemset, and thenw ork on efficiency from there. I realized that this would be straightforward, but nearly impossible to optimize to the oint where it works. So I decided to try and use what we used earlier with a hash function to do the looping through. I was able to make the hash function pretty easily because it was really similar to what we had done previously. Also, at first, I was thinking of using two parallel arrays for keys and values, but the problem with this would have been collisions, so I decided to use an array of lists where each lists wholds keys and values that hash to the same thing. I was also able to build the buildtable function in this time because I thought that it was pretty straightforward in my head. The confusing part was with query because I didn't really understand what was going on with it. To me, the other parts were pretty intuitive inmy approach, so I was able to just code throuhg it. I wasn't able to really test my code because I hadn't done query quite yet, so I didn't really have something to test, but I thought that it went pretty well. |

I decided to use lists because I thought that it fit my intentions a lot better with the problem set, despite having a cost witht he amount of data it holds. This was interesting to figure out, so I had to slightly alter my implementation of the buildtable and hash functions. i also found a couple of errors with making sure that the invalid lines were skipped, so I had to fix that. Other than that, I was vry sure that my buildtable was working at this point in time. |

This was confusing at first because I initially forgot to add a .size(), but I didn't realize it, so it kept showing this weird error because I was literally comparing a number with an array, which makes no sense. I was able to read carefully through it and realized I made that error, so I was able to fix it. I solved this because having given a key, I could hash it to et the index, then loops through the list and if I find the same key, return teh matching value, otehrwise return an invalid key. This was actually pretty straightforward and I realized that it made sense when taking into consideration the other parts of my code. I also realized I had made an error earlier with my constructor, so I had to fix that, but that was also decently straightforward. My code complied, and it actually worked, but it was too slow, so I tried to add improvements with my hash function iand its use in build TAble, but it still was pretty inefficient when I finished my time (although it did pass the test when I ran it, which was pretty ncie to see). |

Realized that my original/first-solution wasn't even too far off what wewere supposed to have. There were definetley a lot of parts that I would need to re-do, but some of the stuff could stay. Decided to start by trying to figure out the table resizing. This went pretty smoothly at first I thought, but I wasn't able to run it at the time because it couldn't complie. I thought the table resizing made a lot of sense in my head due to the efficiency aspects, its just I would also need to slightly tweak my hashing function. This wasn't that bad at all, jsut one variable change, so it was nice that I was able to still use my hash function. |

I wrote the function that was supposed ot be the add function to work with the linaer probing mechanisms with the updated tablesize stuff. This wasn't htat bad at all and it built off of ideas I had in my first version. I was able ot compile it at this point, but there was still some error in there that I couldn't fgure out. The linear probing in both add and get felt pretty simmilar, so that went along pretty smoothly, I just had to now identify my errors. |

I also messed up the adding of key value pairs to the table during the add fucntion. This was pretty confusing at first because it was hard to recognize that I was trying to deal with incomplete rows, which led to a ot of bugs. It required me to really understand how the bufferreader and the split functions worked within the build table function, so I think that was a bit of a learning curve that I had to voercome, because previously I'd just use the split function and not think twice about it. I had to understand how the rows and columns interacted, and once I understood that, I realized that the mistake I was making was a pretty simple aspect of checking that I would run into issues with. This was fixed pretty easily, and I worked through the errors to a point where it compiled, although unforuntunately, it was still slightly too slow. |
| Nov 10 |  4-5pm   | Worked on splitting up my code into different functions,a ccording to what you gave us in the slide shows in order to better my code fluency/abstraction and to make everything relate with each other more clearly. I made a bit of a mistake when copying and pasting within my own cocde and deleted a line, which ended up causing some confusion, but was pretty easily addressed. Then, I started checking how I could make it more efficient. At first I was a bit confused with the horner's method and why we weren't using a large prime number again, but then I realized it made a lot of sense to just use modulus based on the tables size so that it adapted to each table, and the large prime number actually wouldn't speed anything up because it didn't correlate with tablesize. The reason I was confused at first was because my tablesize was a power of 2, but then i realized that we had to use modulus dynamically according to the changing tablesize.To make my code more efficent, I picked a default starting tablesize of 1024, which actually made it run slightly smoother, and made sure that my resize function worked properly with the load factor of 0.5, and with these tweaks, it wasactually running pretty efficiently. It took a bit of experimenting, but I think all of these effiency updates that I made since the version1 actually make a lot of sense, and it makes sense why i pick each number/why I implement each change, which I thought was a good thing that I was truly understainding the core of all of that. |

Ran it and checked it a couple more times, then fixed up the work log, and then submitted it. |
